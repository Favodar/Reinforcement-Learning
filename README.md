# Reinforcement-Learning

Policy iteration is a technique for finding an optimal policy in a given, fully known environment. It is neither fast nor efficient, and the practical applications are therefore limited. However, it is guaranteed to find an optimal policy in finite time, and serves as an important starting point for many reinforcement learning algorithms.
