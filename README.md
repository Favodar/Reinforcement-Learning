# Reinforcement-Learning

Policy iteration is a technique for finding an optimal policy in a given, fully known environment. It is easier to understand than most of today's popular reinforcement learning algorithms, so it is a good entry point for beginners in the subject.
Its practical applications are limited, because it is neither fast nor efficient. However, it is guaranteed to find an optimal policy in finite time, and its ideas can be a basis for many reinforcement learning algorithms.
