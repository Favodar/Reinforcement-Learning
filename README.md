# Reinforcement-Learning

Source code for the website ["Quick Introduction To Reinforcement Learning"](https://favodar.github.io/Reinforcement-Learning/) and accompanying Jupyter Notebook [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Favodar/Reinforcement-Learning/master?filepath=Jacks-Car-Rental%2FPolicyIterationNotebook.ipynb) and python code example for policy iteration. 

Policy iteration is a technique for finding an optimal policy in a given, fully known environment. It is easier to understand than most of today's popular reinforcement learning algorithms, so it is a good entry point for beginners in the subject.
Its practical applications are limited, because it is neither fast nor efficient. However, it is guaranteed to find an optimal policy in finite time, and its ideas can be a basis for many reinforcement learning algorithms.

The "docs" folder contains the html, css and js files for the [website](https://favodar.github.io/Reinforcement-Learning/) which is hosted via GitHub pages.

The "Jacks-Car-Rental" folder contains the Jupyter Notebook files. There you can also access the code of "CarRentalEnvironment", which implements the environment (a Markov decision process) described in the "Jack's Car Rental" excercise in "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction".
